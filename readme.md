## Synopsis

This project was my Q2 project at the Galvanize Web Development Immersive. The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack application in a week. The initial motivation for this project was to create a tool to improve discoverability of videos of world-record video game speedruns. Everyone who is into the speedrun community has a favorite game or two that they love watching the speedrun of and allowing users to share them with others in the community could potentially be a fun and useful tool.

## Technology Used

This project currently uses HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Javascript (ES6), jQuery (for compatibility with Bootstrap modals) and Axios.
